### Highlights
The player can place turrets to fend off the attack and reactors that generate positive energy over time.  Dispensers can be used to launch a drone to attack an enemy spawner.  The player completes the level by accumulating enough energy from their reactors to reach the level target.  If enough enemy ships make it through the player's defences, the player's energy level reaches zero, and the player is defeated.  

I developed the game from scratch in Unity using C#, including all level generation and path finding code.  I modeled all 3D assets from scratch in Blender and used Substance Painter and Photoshop to create the textures.
